I am a musician, writer and software developer not necessarily in that order depending on the day. This website serves as a sort of haphazard living autobiography. 

I would like to state that it is written for an audience of one, me, but that would be a lie. I suffer just enough from megalomania to believe that others might be interested in my ramblings. 

Practically speaking this website is a platform for documenting my ever evolving interests, ideas and life experiences.
